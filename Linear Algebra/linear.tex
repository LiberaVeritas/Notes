\section{Vectors}

Vectors are a way of describing things along different dimensions or aspects.
Each coordinate of the vector describes the quantity along each dimension.
The standard basis vectors \( e_i \)
are vectors whose quantities are just 1 along the dimension \( i \)
and zero for the others.
Thus,
any vector \( v \) is just the linear combination of its coordinates
with the corresponding basis vectors
\( v_1 e_1 + \dots + v_n e_n \).

Geometrically, we can think of a vector \( \vb{v} \) as a position in \( \R^n \),
whose position along each axis is specified by the coordinates of \( \vb{v} \).

Another way to think about a vector is as a displacement.
For example,
we can think of \( \va{v} \) as the change from the position \( \vb{0} \) to \( \vb{v} \),
or \( \va{v} = \vb{v} - \vb{0} \).

\subsection{Addition and subtraction}

Adding a vector to another is simply just adding the quantities along each dimension.
Subtraction is taking the difference.

Geometrically, we can add two vectors \( \vb{u} \) and \( \vb{v} \)
by considering where we end up if we start at position \( \vb{u} \)
then apply the change \( \va{v} \).
Thus, \( \vb{u} + \va{v} = \vb{z} \).

\noindent
\input{fig/vector/2}

Since \( \vb{u} \) is also a change from \( \vb{0} \),
we can think of \( \va u + \va v \) as the composition of two changes as well.

We have already seen vector subtraction.
We see that \( \va{z} = \vb{u} - \vb{v} \)
is just the change in position from \( \vb{v} \) to \( \vb{u} \).

\noindent
\input{fig/vector/3}

Since this is a change in position,
it doesn't matter from where we apply the change.
If we think of \( \vb{v} \) as our zero,
then \( \vb v + \va z = \vb v + ( \vb u - \vb v ) = \vb u \).

\section{Matrices}

A matrix is just a bunch of vectors put together.
Then matrix multiplication by a vector is just a linear combination of the matrix vectors
with the coefficients of the multiplying vector.
\[ Mv = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
    \vb{m_1}, \vb{m_2}, \dots, \vb{m_n}
    \end{pmatrix}
    v
    = v_1 \vb{m_1} + \dots + v_n \vb{m_n}.
\]
In other words,
we are treating the matrix vectors as a new kind of "basis" vectors or dimensions,
and we are describing a new vector with the same quantities along the new dimensions.
In this way, a matrix represents a new set of dimensions or matrix vectors,
each of which are still described with the standard basis.

\noindent
\input{fig/vector/4}

Multiplying two matrices together is just multiplying a matrix by multiple vectors
\[ MN = (\vb{m_1}, \dots, \vb{m_i})(\vb{n_1}, \dots, \vb{n_i})
    = ([n_{1_1} \vb{m_1} + \dots + n_{1_j} \vb{m_i}], \dots, 
       [n_{i_1} \vb{m_1} + \dots + n_{i_j} \vb{m_i}])
\]
