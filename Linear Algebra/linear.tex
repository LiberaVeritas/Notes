\section{Vectors}

A vector in \( \R^n \) is an ordered \( n \)-tuple of elements of \( \R \).
Geometrically, we can think of a vector \( \vb{v} \) as a position in \( \R^n \),
whose position a long each axis is specified by the coordinates of \( \vb{v} \).

Another way to think about a vector is as a change in position.
For example,
we can think of \( \va{v} \) as the change from the position \( \vb{0} \) to \( \vb{v} \),
or \( \va{v} = \vb{v} - \vb{0} \).

\subsection{Addition and subtraction}

We can add two vectors \( \vb{u} \) and \( \vb{v} \)
by considering where we end up if we start at position \( \vb{u} \)
then apply the change \( \va{v} \).
Thus, \( \vb{u} + \va{v} = \vb{z} \).

\noindent
\input{fig/vector/2}

Since \( \vb{u} \) is also a change from \( \vb{0} \),
we can think of \( \va u + \va v \) as the composition of two changes as well.

We have already seen vector subtraction.
We see that \( \va{z} = \vb{u} - \vb{v} \)
is just the change in position from \( \vb{v} \) to \( \vb{u} \).

\noindent
\input{fig/vector/3}

Since this is a change in position,
it doesn't matter from where we apply the change.
If we think of \( \vb{v} \) as our zero,
then \( \vb v + \va z = \vb v + ( \vb u - \vb v ) = \vb u \).
